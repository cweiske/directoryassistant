**About**

Directory Assistant is a small application for managing a LDAP 
address book. The focus is to create a very easy to use program,
with only the few but necessary features. The target is novice 
users that still need to keep their addresses in an LDAP server.

If you want an advanced application targeted at power users, 
check out http://biot.com/gq/.

**Download & install**

Unpack the tarball, cd directoryassistant-1.0/ and run ./install.py. 
It will show you the few files that are copied. (note: if it complains 
about not having the gtk module installed, and you are sure you have 
it, make sure you run the ./install.py script under X)

Configuration is stored in /etc/directoryassistant or in ~/.directoryassistant

[My Ldap Server]
ldapurl = ldap://your.ldap.server.com/
bind_dn = cn=someaccount,o=someorg
bind_password = yourpassword
base_dn = ou=department,ou=People,o=someorg
add_dn = ou=myunit,ou=department,ou=People,o=someorg
ldapversion = 3
startup_search = 

if you leave 'startup_search' empty, it will show all ldap entries

**Translations**

First update the message catalog messages.pot `xgettext -L python directoryassistant`

If there is no translation yet, copy messages.po to LANG.po
If there is a translation already, merge the new messages with the 
existing translation:
`msgmerge --output-file=tmp.po nl.po messages.po && mv tmp.po LANG.po`
Then edit LANG.po to fix any untranslated strings
